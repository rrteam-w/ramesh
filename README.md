# Online-Banking-System-Database-Design
Database design for an online banking system

This project was designed as a part of the RR-Team OLB 

The purpose of this project is to develop an online banking database design that provides banks with the facility to organize information related to the employees, customers and other relevant information in an efficient manner. A database design is an important part of any system. Application design traditionally consists of two steps: you develop a logical model of the business process you're automating, then you map that model to the database by creating a physical model, which is implemented as a series of tables. Thus, a database design definitely makes an impact on the overall efficiency of a system.

In this technologically advanced era, most of the banking transactions are done online. Hence, this is an increasingly interesting topic to study as this project deals with banking database design. The project report consists of information on logical and physical design of the database, tables created, queries used to generate different views. Recommendations to improve the database and problems faced and lessons learnt are also a part of the project report.
